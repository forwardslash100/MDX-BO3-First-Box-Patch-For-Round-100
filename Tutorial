# HOW TO CUSTOMIZE THE FIRST BOX PATCH

Customizing the first box patch to change the map and weapons is very possible.
To do this you want to find the codename of the map / weapon you want to apply the patch on, I have a whole file made for this in the repository which goes through almost all weapons in the game for their codename.
just simply replace the codenames in the two speech marks to change them.
